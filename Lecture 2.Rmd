#Abstract

We reproduced the life expectancy analysis from Ger and Et Al. 

This is a reivew of last week. 

Recall that we must do git init to indicate that this (where this file is saved) is a git repository. 

Recall git status shows us untracked files that are in our directory. 

Then git add and then git status shows us changes that have yet to be committed! 

Exercise #1, see life_exp! 

git status now says we modified life_exp but did not commit it! 

So we commit it!
